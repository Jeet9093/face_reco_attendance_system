# face_reco_attendance_system
This project presents a smart Face Recognition Attendance Management System designed to automate 
and enhance traditional attendance tracking methods. Built using Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascades,
and deep learning models, the system captures real-time facial data, processes it using machine learning
algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and records attendance with high accuracy. A Flask-based web 
interface displays daily attendance reports in an accessible format. The system emphasizes security,
usability, and scalability, supporting future features like mobile access, cloud deployment, and IoT integration.
It eliminates common issues like buddy punching, manual errors, and inefficiencies while offering analytics 
and insights to administrators. Through continuous improvement and compliance with data privacy standards,
this project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly solution for educational and organizational attendance management.
